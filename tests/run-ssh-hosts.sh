# tests/run-ssh-hosts.sh: real-SSH-host acceptance for modulejail.
#
# Runs the modulejail smoke suite against live Linux hosts via SSH. The set is
# HOSTS-overridable; the default is the always-on Debian/Ubuntu-family hosts
# (ubuntu-wifi, debian13). RHEL/Fedora-family real-kernel coverage is driven
# by a local, environment-specific gate that starts the (default-off) Proxmox
# test VMs and passes their aliases via HOSTS (that gate is not committed; it
# holds site-specific hostnames/IPs). Any host name works as long as it
# resolves through the caller's ~/.ssh/config.
#
# Each host gets:
#   1. /etc/os-release capture (evidence pin; also drives the SELinux
#      family-detection below)
#   2. modulejail copied over to /tmp/mj-test
#   3. --version exit-0 check
#   4. Bad-flag → EX_USAGE=64 check
#   5. Directory-as-output → EX_CANTCREAT=73 check
#   6. Successful run with -o /tmp/mj-host-run1.conf (non-root, write-to-/tmp;
#      original methodology preserved, no risk to host /etc/modprobe.d/)
#   7. Idempotency: second run → cmp byte-identical
#   8. Success-line shape regex check on the run-6 stdout
#   9. Generated file header shape: line 1 = "# modulejail <VERSION>"
#      (VERSION auto-derived from the modulejail script under test, so
#      the assertion survives future SemVer bumps without edits),
#      line 5 = "# fingerprint: sha256:<64 hex>"
#  10. Portability grep assertion (no per-distro branches in the script that
#      was just copied over)
#
# Special handling for RHEL/Fedora family (detected from each host's own
# /etc/os-release, not a hardcoded name): SELinux may deny non-root reads in
# parts of /lib/modules/<ver>/, which legitimately trips EX_OSERR=71 ("find
# reported errors"). If we observe rc=71 on such a host, the harness records
# it as documented expected behavior (not a regression) and proceeds with the
# remaining hosts. The SUMMARY notes this for the README's Cross-distro section.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all hosts passed (or a RHEL/Fedora host surfaced documented EX_OSERR=71)
#   1  at least one host failed an assertion in an unexpected way
#   2  unable to reach one or more hosts (SSH connection failure)
