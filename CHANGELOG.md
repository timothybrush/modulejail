## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- New `--whitelist-file PATH` flag (closes [#2](https://github.com/jnuyens/modulejail/issues/2)).
  Reads a site-local whitelist file (one module name per line, `#` comments,
  blank lines ignored), validates each line against `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+`, refuses
  group- or world-writable files, and appends valid names to the in-script
  `WHITELIST`. Operators no longer lose site-local additions on
  `.deb` / `.rpm` / `curl | sh` reinstalls.
- New `--no-syslog-logging` flag. Forces the v1.1.4-style
  `install <name> /bin/true` install-line body, for operators who require
  byte-identical output across versions or run on hosts without
  `/usr/bin/logger`.
- New `MODULEJAIL_LOGGER_PATH` env-var override (test-only plumbing, parallel
  to `MODULEJAIL_PROC_MODULES` / `MODULEJAIL_KVER` / `MODULEJAIL_MODULES_ROOT`).
- New `MODULEJAIL_MODULES_ROOT` env-var override (test-only plumbing) — lets
  host-local test cases on non-Linux dev boxes exercise the full pipeline
  against a synthetic `/lib/modules` tree.
- New header annotation `# install-line: ...` documents which install-line
  form is in the generated file.
- New regression fixture under `tests/fixtures/v1.1.4-regression/` pinning
  v1.1.4 output as a permanent baseline (`tests/cases/v1.1.4-regression.sh`).
- Eight new acceptance cases under `tests/cases/`: five for `--whitelist-file`
  (happy path, missing file, bad permissions, malformed module name,
  comments-and-blanks), three for the logger install-line forms
  (default-on, opt-out, absent-fallback).

### Changed

- **Default behaviour change:** when `/usr/bin/logger` is executable on the
  host running modulejail (and `--no-syslog-logging` is not set), generated
  install lines now call `logger -t modulejail "blocked: <name>"` so blocked
  module load attempts produce a syslog entry tagged `modulejail`. View via:
    - `journalctl -t modulejail --since '1 hour ago'` on systemd hosts
    - `grep modulejail /var/log/syslog` on syslog hosts

  Set `--no-syslog-logging` to restore the exact v1.1.4 install-line body.
  The generated file's header annotation (`# install-line: ...`) records
  which form was emitted.

### Security

- Whitelist file is rejected if its mode allows group-write or world-write
  (`mode & 022 != 0`), exiting `EX_NOPERM=77` with a `chmod go-w PATH` hint.
  Same hardening sshd applies to `authorized_keys` and sudo applies to
  `sudoers`. Each non-comment line is strictly validated against
  `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+` to prevent command injection into the generated
  `modprobe.d` file. Rejection exits `EX_DATAERR=65` with a stderr message
  citing the file path, line number, and offending content.

### Internal

- New `EX_DATAERR=65` constant in the sysexits.h block (numeric order between
  `EX_USAGE=64` and `EX_NOINPUT=66`). Documented exit code in `--help`.
- POSIX-portable octal mode parsing (no bashism `$((8#$x))`); shellcheck
  `--shell=sh` clean.
- Pre-existing latent bug fixed: the `cleanup()` EXIT trap's
  `[ -n "$tmp" ] && rm -f "$tmp"` last command silently clobbered explicit
  `exit $EX_*` codes under dash/POSIX `/bin/sh` whenever `$tmp` was still
  empty. Rewritten as an `if`/`then` block with an explicit trailing
  `return 0`. Surfaced by the new whitelist-file rejection paths.
- `tests/run-fixtures.sh` gained `--filter PATTERN` mode for host-local case
  scripts under `tests/cases/`; the default no-flag mode (full distro fixture
  matrix) is unchanged.
- Header annotation does NOT enter the fingerprint computation (fingerprint
  is a function of canonical inputs — kernel, profile, loaded, baseline,
  whitelist — not render-time decisions). Two runs on identical inputs with
  different `--no-syslog-logging` states therefore produce different
  install-line bodies but the same `# fingerprint:` line, preserving the
  v1.0.0 fleet-correlation contract.

### Drivers

- GitHub [Issue #2](https://github.com/jnuyens/modulejail/issues/2)
  (bpmartin20) — external whitelist persistence ask.
- Vincent Homans (email feedback, 2026-05-13) — syslog visibility ask and
  modprobe-override-scope clarification ask.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- Project logo on the README.

### Changed

- Container fixture is version-agnostic (no longer hardcoded to `1.0.0`
  strings) and gains four new assertions covering the v1.1.x update-check
  surface, including a static regression guard against the v1.1.2
  busybox-wget bug.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- Update check now works on Alpine / busybox wget. The wget invocation used
  GNU long-form flags (`--quiet`, `--max-redirect=5`, `--output-document=-`)
  that busybox wget rejects, causing the check to silently exit non-zero on
  every Alpine host. Switched to the universal short-flag subset
  (`-q`, `-T 10`, `-O -`) and dropped `--max-redirect` (the GitHub tags API
  does not redirect).

## [1.1.2] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- `modulejail(8)` manpage, installed at `/usr/share/man/man8/modulejail.8.gz`.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Swap the order of `Why?` and `What ModuleJail is` in the README so the
  motivation leads.
- Drop the per-distro `%dist` suffix from the RPM filename (was
  `modulejail-X.Y.Z-1.el9.noarch.rpm`, now `modulejail-X.Y.Z-1.noarch.rpm`).
  ModuleJail is a noarch shell script with no per-major-RHEL semantics.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- `.deb` and `.rpm` packaging under `packaging/` with
  `packaging/build.sh` driver.
- Optional post-run check for a newer release on GitHub: silent on any
  failure mode, 10-second hard timeout, only complains when reachable and a
  newer tag exists. Honours `MODULEJAIL_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=<any non-empty>`
  to disable.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Documentation cleanup release.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Initial release. Single POSIX shell script that snapshots
  `/proc/modules`, walks `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)`, computes the complement
  against a built-in baseline plus the sysadmin `WHITELIST`, and writes a
  `modprobe.d` blacklist file.
- Three baseline profiles (`minimal`, `conservative`, `desktop`).
- SemVer `VERSION` constant; sysexits.h-aligned exit codes
  (`64`, `66`, `70`, `71`, `73`, `77`).
- Deterministic SHA-256 fingerprint header — byte-identical idempotency on
  identical inputs.
- Cross-distro support (Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/Rocky/Fedora, Arch, Alpine,
  openSUSE) with no per-distro code branches.
- Container fixture harness (`tests/run-fixtures.sh`) and SSH-host
  acceptance harness (`tests/run-ssh-hosts.sh`).
- GPL-3.0-only license.
